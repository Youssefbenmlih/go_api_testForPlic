## GO BACK VS PYTHON BACK

:: Database is Postgresql ::

# Go server

Made with gin and gorm, it was pretty easy to get into it, the doc is fine and provides all the necessary orm features.

GO's ADVANTAGES :

- Pretty simple language.
- Would make us learn a new language, and learning new things is always a plus.
- Gorm and gin work well and are not too difficult to get accustomed to and have great doc (in my opinion I found that gorm had a better doc than flask_sqlalchemy).
- It is a google made technology, the same as our front-end, they both are very fast and agile (they have compatibility).

GO's DRAWBACKS :

- It will take some time for us to learn the syntax and the overall language as well as its basic libraries.
- How it works and the potential errors we will undoubtedly get will take time and effort to fix.
- We have no experience of the language with back-end developpement.
- It is less popular than python, meaning fewer libraries, stackoverflow posts and a smaller community overall.
- I found gin to be less "pretty" (in how it makes the user declare it's endpoints) and easy to read compared to python's flask, you can see it for yourself in the source code.

# Python server

Made with flask and flask_SQLAlchemy, for me it was very easy to get into it when i made my first backend a while ago.

PYTHON's ADVANTAGES :

- The simplest language, it is very easy to read, browse and understand source code.
- We have experience in python, some of us have even made back-end in python (me for example), alot of potential errors we will face will be in our memory.
- Flask and flask_SQLAlchemy are very simple frameworks with great documentation.
- Python is a considered by many as one of the best back-end languages (with js) meaning we will never be stuck with an unsolvable problem.
- Python has an enourmous community with a lot of tested and overall trusted libraries for almost anything.
- the structure of the back-end is simple and in my opinion easier to read, use and add code than go.

PYTHON's DRAWBACKS :

- It is a slower language than go, even if our app doesn't need high performance it is still the case that python is the slower language.
- Despite the loss of time on go it is always good to learn a new language and python would not help us in that regard.
- it is not a google tech.

That's it for the comparison, the best way to choose is to try both server, better even is to remake-them and make your own opinion. please add your vote in this file.
